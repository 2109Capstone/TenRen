### Introduction

Robin Noob is a cryptocurrency trading app that allows users to trade cryptocurrency based on real-time data. Real money is not required since the game is simulation based.

The game also provides cryptocurrency news based on historical timeline of when users are trading -- allowing users to make informed decisions.

Interactive line charts have been implemented to visualize user progress and keep track of their asset portfolio.

Website has been designed with mobile responsiveness in mind
