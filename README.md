# Introduction

Robin Noob is a cryptocurrency trading simulation game that stores realtime and past-time data of cryptocurrency. It shows cached cryptocurrency news from Bings News Search API. You can train your trading skills by playing in our simulated modes without having to use real money. Responsive line charts are also implemented to visualize user progression for gain and loss based on user input (implemented via charts.js).
