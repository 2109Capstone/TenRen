### Introduction

Robin Noob is a cryptocurrency trading simulation game that stores real-time and past-time data of cryptocurrency prices. It also shows cached cryptocurrency news from Bings News Search API. You can train your trading skills by playing in our simulated modes without having to use real money. Interactive line charts are also implemented to visualize user progress based on gain and loss of user asset portfolio.

### FAQ

- Why did you build a cryptocurrency application? — There is always fear around new technologies, and people tend to avoid what they don’t quite understand, especially when there are risks involved. We decided to target people who had an interest in cryptocurrency but didn’t want to invest in real world money. Our application allows you to practice trading for free. In addition, since the application models after real-world data, people can get a better sense of what they would be investing into if they ever did decide to use real money.
- How did the idea come about? — A team member of ours was interested in building upon an already existing cryptocurrency data and news source application. However, someone else on the team was interested in building a game. I mediated between the best of both worlds and decided to gamify upon the already existing data — and thus the idea for a trading simulation app was born. The name Robin Noob is a knockoff of a popular investing app called **Robinhood**.
- How does cryptocurrency news tie in with your application? — When anyone decides to act on any economic interest — whether to invest or to trade, it always helps to bridge the gap between lack of experience or knowledge in regards to the subject of interest. In our application, when you click on any cryptocurrency, its relevant news will be shown. These news articles related to the selected cryptocurrency may explain for price changes in fluctuation, prospects about technological changes (such as advancements or failures), and other causes that might affect your purchasing/selling decision. With news, users feel more empowered in making an informed decision when they buy/sell.
- What inspired CryptoQuiz? — A member of ours was inspired by the game show “Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?” and decided to quiz on cryptocurrency to further educate users.

### Lessons Learned

- I had to implement a queue data structure to schedule delayed requests to work around the API rate limiting of fetch requests.
- With CSS, the use of important! is particularly useful if you’re dealing with front-end libraries that have strict styling requirements.
- Storing data in the form of JSON objects in the database can allow for faster development times if time constraints are an issue.
- Use of classes and functions can be very helpful for cleaning up data, organizing it, and calculating data more dynamically.
